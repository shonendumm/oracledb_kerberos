# To connect to an Oracle database using Kerberos credentials, you need to follow these steps:

# Install the Oracle client on your machine.
# Configure Kerberos. This involves creating a krb5.conf file with the details of your Kerberos server.
# Configure the Oracle client to use Kerberos. This involves creating a sqlnet.ora file and possibly a tnsnames.ora file with the details of your Oracle server.
# Obtain a Kerberos ticket using the kinit command.
# Use the Oracle client to connect to the Oracle server.

# The following example demonstrates how to connect to an Oracle database using Kerberos credentials in Python:
# pip install cx_Oracle
import cx_Oracle

# Set the Oracle environment variables
import os
os.environ['ORACLE_HOME'] = '/usr/lib/oracle/21/client64'
os.environ['LD_LIBRARY_PATH'] = '/usr/lib/oracle/21/client64/lib'
os.environ['TNS_ADMIN'] = '/usr/lib/oracle/21/client64/network/admin'

# Connect to the Oracle database using Kerberos credentials
dsn = """
(DESCRIPTION=
    (ADDRESS=(PROTOCOL=TCP)(HOST=example.com)(PORT=1521))
    (CONNECT_DATA=
        (SERVICE_NAME=orcl)
    )
)
"""

connection = cx_Oracle.connect(
    dsn=dsn,
    kerberos=True
)
# Note: Make sure to replace the placeholders (username, password, hostname, port, servicename, and table_name) with the actual values for your Oracle database.

# Create a cursor object
cursor = connection.cursor()

# Execute a query
cursor.execute('SELECT * FROM table_name')

# Fetch the results
for row in cursor:
    print(row)

# Close the cursor and connection
cursor.close()
connection.close()

# Note: Make sure to replace the placeholders (username, password, hostname, port, servicename, and table_name) with the actual values for your Oracle database.

# This example assumes that you have already configured Kerberos and the Oracle client on your machine. If you encounter any issues, make sure to check the Oracle client configuration files (sqlnet.ora, tnsnames.ora, krb5.conf) and the Kerberos ticket obtained using the kinit command.

# For more information on connecting to an Oracle database using Kerberos credentials, refer to the Oracle documentation and the cx_Oracle documentation.
